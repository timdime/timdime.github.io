      - title: Embed External Trading Groups
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Work with established traders and/or groups to understand their IT so they can successfully be embedded into Belvedere's environment and trade day 1. Every trader or group had different requirements. Most used 3rd party trading software where I needed to coordinate setup with ProOpticus, Aciv, TT, SpiderRock, OptionsCity, etc. and confirm access to different exchanges or execution venues, as well as access to market data, without compromising Belvedere's network. Some groups even had their own software and hardware, which was more challenging and even required some ETL of files dropped by Clearing to only provide them filtered data if the Clearing firm couldn't drop files only for their accounts."

      - title: Performance Monitoring
        link: "#"
        tagline: "I have created many inputs for capturing infrastructure metrics, as they relate to Belvedere Software, to help analyze performance on clients, hosts, and the network across environments. This has been accomplished by writing custom scripts in vbs, powershell, perl, bash and python to pull application instance level stats into different performance monitoring tools (telegraf/influx/grafana and splunk) in response to users reporting issues or logged errors when there is no clear infrastructure bottleneck when monitoring using general tools (host performance counters, iperf, etc.). This effort has proven useful over the years and helped resolve many inefficiencies, or even bugs, with development. Also, developed a load tester to gauge requests per second over a sustained period of a development instance of ConfigHub to determine when and why timeouts were occurring and profile correct tuning settings and resource requirements in production, given actual load."
